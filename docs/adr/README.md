# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory documents significant architectural decisions made during development.
Each decision is captured when it's made not retroactively.

## Format

Each ADR follows this template:

- **Context:** What problem are we solving?
- **Decision:** What did we decide?
- **Alternatives considered:** What else did we evaluate?
- **Consequences:** What are the trade-offs?
- **Date:** When was this decided?
